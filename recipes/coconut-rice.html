    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>Coconut milk</li>
        <li>Cups of water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil or butter</li>
        <li>Onion, finely chopped (ptional)</li>
        <li>1-2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
        <li>Peas or diced carrots (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro or parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>Seasoning cubes</li>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Crayfish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>    
  <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps to remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky.</li>
  <li>In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil or butter over medium heat. If using, add the chopped onion and garlic, and saut√© until they are soft and fragrant.</li>
  <li>Add the rinsed rice to the pot and stir to coat the rice with the oil and mix with the onions and garlic. Cook for a couple of minutes to lightly toast the rice.</li>
  <li>Pour in the coconut milk and water. The ratio of liquid to rice is typically 2:1, so for every cup of rice, use one cup of coconut milk and one cup of water. Add salt and seasoning cubes to taste.</li>
  <li>If using peas or diced carrots, add them to the pot at this stage.</li>
    <li>Add meat and crayfish to the pot.</li>
    <li>Stir the mixture well to combine all the ingredients.</li>
  <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed all the liquid.</li>
  <li>Once cooked, remove the pot from heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 5-10 minutes. This allows the rice to steam and become fluffy.</li>
  <li>Fluff the rice with a fork before serving. Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley if desired. Serve hot as a side dish or with your favorite main course.</li>
</ol>
